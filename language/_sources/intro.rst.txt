Introduction
============

Motivation
----------

Why create yet another programming language? Like, there isn't enough of them already?

I have asked myself these questions hundreds of times, over and over again. I can name dozens of possible arguments against creating a new programming language. I understand all the difficulties a language creator is doomed to face before he can gather any meaningful number of users of the new language. And I still believe that the creation of Jancy was justified. The truth is, Jancy was not created just to fix the infamous fatal flaw of other languages (aka **they didn't write it**). Of course, the passion to invent was a significant driving force, but there was **practical** reasoning besides that.

During the development of a product called `IO Ninja <http://tibbo.com/ninja>`_ (a universal all-in-one low-level IO debugger) we were looking for a scripting language with the support for **safe pointers** and **safe pointer arithmetics**. We wanted to use scripting for adding new protocol analyzers and emulators, and the best way of parsing binary data is by a long shot C-structs and pointer arithmetics.

After not finding such language, we basically had a choice: either we settle for some existing scripting language without safe pointer arithmetics (say, embedded Python) or create a new scripting language -- tailor-suited for the **binary data stream** processing. Create it both for ourselves, and for other developers who could be in need for such a scripting language. Needless to say, we had chosen the latter option -- otherwise, you would not be reading this manual.

Of course, besides featuring safe pointers and safe pointer arithmetics, Jancy offers a long list of other useful but rarely found facilities. So let's outline the distinguishing features of Jancy below. And for those of you wondering **what's in a name**, Jancy is an acronym: [in-between] Java-and-C.

Design Principles
-----------------

* Object-oriented scripting language for IO and UI programming with C-family syntax
* ABI (application-binary-interface) compatibility with C
* Automatic memory management via accurate GC (garbage collection)
* LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine) as a back-end

Key Features
------------

* High level of ABI and source compatibility with C
* Safe pointers and pointer arithmetic
* Spreadsheet-like Reactive Programming
* Efficient regex-based switches for writing incremental lexers/scanners
* Dynamic structures with variable-length fields
* Dual error handling model which allows both throw-catch semantics and error code checks -- with the same function!

Other Notable Features
----------------------

* Properties (the most comprehensive implementation thereof)
* Multicasts and events (including weak events, which do not require to unsubscribe)
* Scheduled function pointers
* Deterministic resource release
* Multiple inheritance
* Const-correctness
* Thread local storage
* Weak pointers (do not retain objects)
* Partial application for functions and properties
* Context-sensitive dual modifiers
* Bitflag enums
* Perl-style formatting
* Hexadimal, binary, raw and multi-line literals
