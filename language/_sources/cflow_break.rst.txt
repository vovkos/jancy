break/continue
==============

Besides tradition ``break`` and ``continue`` with the same syntax and symantics as in C/C++/C#/Java/D, Jancy features multi-level loop jumps. These are achieved with ``break<n>`` and ``continue<n>`` and are used to control *outer* loops:

.. code-block:: jnc

	int a[3][4] = {
		{ 1,  2,  3,  4 },
		{ 5,  6, -7,  8 },
		{ 9, 10, 11, 12 },
	};

	for (size_t i = 0; i < countof(a); i++)
		for (size_t j = 0; j < countof(a[0]); j++)
			if (a[i][j] < 0) {
				// negative element is found, process it...

				break2; // exit 2 loops at once
			}
