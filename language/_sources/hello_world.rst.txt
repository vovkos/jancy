Hello World
-----------

Tradition dictates to start any language book with a **"Hello World"** program, so I'm not going to re-invent the wheel in this paricular case:

.. code-block:: jnc

	int main() {
		printf("hello world!\n");
		return 0;
	}

No explanation is needed, I suppose? Keeping Jancy language syntax as close to C/C++/Java as possible was imperative, and I believe a very pleasant level of source-level compatibility was eventually achieved. Any experienced C, C++ or Java programmer should be able to read and understand most of Jancy code from the get-go, without any special training. Moreover, often times it is possible to simply copy-paste C/C++/Java code snippets into Jancy source files and compile them with little to no modifications.
