Indexed Properties
==================

Jancy also supports **indexed** properties, which are properties with array semantics. Accessors for such properties accept additional index arguments, but unlike a real array index, a property index doesn't have to be of the integer type, nor does it mean **index** exclusively -- it is up to the developer how to use it.

Simple indexed property declaration syntax:

.. code-block:: jnc

	int g_x[2];

	int indexed property g_simpleProp (unsigned i);

	// here the index argument is really used as the array index

	int g_simpleProp.get(unsigned i) {
		return g_x[i];
	}

	g_simpleProp.set(
		unsigned i,
		int x
	) {
		g_x[i] = x;
	}

A similar property declared using full syntax:

.. code-block:: jnc

	property g_prop {
		int m_x[2][2];

		// more than one index argument could be used

		int get(
			unsigned i,
			unsigned j
		) {
			return m_x[i][j];
		}

		set(
			unsigned i,
			unsigned j,
			int x
		) {
			m_x[i][j] = x;
		}

		// setters of indexed property can be overloaded

		set(
			unsigned i,
			unsigned j,
			double x
		) {
			m_x[i][j] = (int) x;
		}
	}

Accessing indexed properties looks like accessing arrays

.. code-block:: jnc

	int indexed property g_prop (
		unsigned i,
		unsigned j
	);

	void foo() {
		int value = g_prop[10][20];

		// ...

		g_prop[30][40] = 100;

		// ...
	}
