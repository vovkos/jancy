# Data Storage Control &amp; RAII

## Data Storage Control

Jancy gives developers full control over what storage to use during a particular operation. This includes member field allocation, global & local variables, allocations induced by casts, as well as allocations performed by the 'new' operator.

<div class='new_frame snippet'>
<code name="jancy">

class C1
{
	int m_memberField;
	static int m_staticField = 2;
	thread int m_threadField;
	thread int m_threadField2 = 3; // <-- error: thread fields cannot be initialized
}

int g_staticGlobal; // for global variables, default storage is 'static'
thread int g_threadGlobal;
thread int g_threadGlobal2 = 10; // <-- error: global thread variables cannot be initialized
thread C1 g_threadGlobal3;       // <-- error: thread variables cannot be aggregate

foo ()
{
	int x; // for local variables, default storage is 'stack'
	static int s = 100; 
	thread int t = 200; // for local 'thread' variables, initialization is permitted
	heap char a [256];  // 'heap' storage can be used to allocate local variables on gc-heap
}

</code>
</div>

<br>
A few words must be said about the data storage specifics for class variables or fields.
As explained in the section dedicated to [classes](classes.html), a declaration of a class variable or field is not implicitly converted to a class pointer. It is actually an instruction that tells the compiler to create an instance of this class.

It is, therefore, possible to share memory blocks between multiple class instances by declaring class fields, much like in C++.

<div class='new_frame snippet'>
<code name="jancy">

class C1 
{
    // ...
}

class C2
{
    // ...

    C1 m_classField; // allocated as part of C2 layout
}

</code>
</div>

<br>
Global variables of class types are allocated statically, while local variables of class types are allocated on the GC heap by default, unless specified otherwise.

<div class='new_frame snippet'>
<code name="jancy">

class C1 
{
    // ...
}

C1 g_classVariable; // allocated statically

foo ()
{
    C1 a;        // allocated on heap (same as: C1* a = heap new C1;)
    stack C1 b;  // allocated on stack (same as: C1* b = stack new C1;)
    static C2 c; // allocated statically (same as: C1* c = static new C1;)

    // ...
}

</code>
</div>

## RAII

The possibility of explicit stack allocation for classes means that in Jancy you are free to use the RAII paradigm (resource-acquisition-is-initialization), just like you would in C++.
Classes allocated on stack are destructed upon exiting the scope thus ensuring deterministic resource release.

<div class='new_frame snippet'>
<code name="jancy">

class Resource
{
	construct ()
	{
		// acquire
	}

	destruct ()
	{
		// release
	}
}

foo (int x)
{
	stack new Resource;

	if (x >= 0)
	{
		stack Resource anotherResource;
		// ...
	} // anotherResource is released
	
	// ...

	return 0; // the 1st resource is released
}

</code>
</div>
