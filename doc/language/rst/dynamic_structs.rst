Dynamic Structs
===============

Jancy is not the first language to introduce *dynamic structs* per se -- many languages support introspection/reflection facilities, which allow modifying the type system at runtime. Making them, you know, dynamic.

However, dynamic structs in Jancy allow something that's simply not possible with any other language -- and that is, self-description. The lengths of some fields may be non-constanct and expressed as a function of other fields of the same struct (e.g. "length"/"count" fields), by null-termination, etc. This approach is used in many file formats and network protocols (think of TCP/IP variable-length fields).

.. rubric:: Example:

.. code-block:: jnc

	dynamic struct FileHdr {
		uint32_t m_signature;
		uint32_t m_sectionCount;
		Section m_sectionTable[m_sectionCount];
		uint32_t m_version;
		char m_authorName[strlen (m_authorName) + 1];
		char m_authorEmail[strlen (m_authorEmail) + 1];
	}

After defining a dynamic struct, just overlap a pointer to it with a buffer and access the fields normally, just the way you would with a regular C struct:

.. code-block:: jnc

	FileHdr	const* hdr = (FileHdr const*) buffer;

	printf(
		"signature:   %.4s (0x%08x)\n"
		"sections:    %d\n"
		"version:     %d.%d.%d (0x%06x)\n"
		"author:      %s\n"
		"email:       %s\n",
		&hdr.m_signature,
		hdr.m_signature,
		hdr.m_sectionCount,
		(hdr.m_version & 0xff0000) >> 16,
		(hdr.m_version & 0x00ff00) >> 8,
		(hdr.m_version & 0x0000ff),
		hdr.m_version,
		hdr.m_authorName,
		hdr.m_authorEmail
		);

All calculated offsets are cached and then re-used during the next access, so you don't have to worry much about the performance aspect of dynamic structs.

You can even fill the buffer using a non-const dynamic struct pointer. Just make sure you assign the fields in correct order (usually, top-to-bottom), so that dynamic offsets could be calculated correctly.

To get the actual size of a dynamic struct, you can apply a ``dynamic sizeof`` operator:

.. code-block:: jnc

	size_t size = dynamic sizeof(*p);

.. rubric:: Restrictions:

Of course, given the fact that the size of such struct is dynamically calculated, there are natural limitations applied:

* Can't allocate a dynamic struct, can only have a pointer to it;
* Pointer subtraction is illegal;
* Pointer increment is only allowed for ``+1`` delta, e.g.:

	.. code-block:: jnc

		p++;

Another thing to consider when using dynamic structs is this. Dynamic offsets are cached for efficiency, as has been said above. However, this cache is a double-edged sword when you need to re-use the same buffer for different data. The cache, of course, knows nothing about that, so it will keep reporting the now-erroneous offsets.

To combat that, be sure to reset the cache with ``jnc.resetDynamicLayout`` before re-using the same buffer with new data:

.. code-block:: jnc

	memcpy (buffer, newData, newDataSize);
	jnc.resetDynamicLayout (buffer);

	FileHdr	const* hdr = (FileHdr const*) buffer;

	// offsets will be re-calculated on access
