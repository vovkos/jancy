Structs/Unions
==============

Jancy supports structs and unions almost the same way C/C++ does. There are certain nuances, though.

Structs/Unions vs Classes
-------------------------

There is a clear distinction between struct/unions and classes in Jancy.

**Structs and unions** represent simple **data blocks**. Variables or fields of struct or union types can be assigned to one another which results in simple ``memcpy``.

More **complex data** structures which *cannot be memcpy-ed* must be represented by :ref:`classes <classes>`.

There are two limitation imposed on structs and unions in Jancy.

1. Structs and unions can have **no virtual** methods.

	Virtual function calls in Jancy (just like in C++, Java and most other OOP languages) are implemented via implicit pointer to ``vtable``, or *virtual method table*. Neither structs nor unions in Jancy have one -- being definitions of simple data blocks, structs and unions only contain the *explicitly declared fields** (and possibly padding to align these fields the same way C/C++ compiler would).

2. Structs and unions can have **no destructors**.

	Firstly, destructors in memcpy-able data structures require extra caution. In C++ this has to be manually handled by the developer via *reference-counting*, *hiding copy-constructors* and assignment-operators or other techniques. But more importantly, *simple* data blocks... well, don't need a destructor! Need to finalize a data structure? Then implement it using classes, not structs or unions!

Unions
------

Unlike in C++, in Jancy it's OK to **derive** from a union:

.. code-block:: jnc

	union MyUnion {
		char m_c;
		short m_s;
		int m_i;
	}

	struct MyStruct: MyUnion {
		long m_l;
	}

The layout will be equivalent to the following C++ code snippet:

.. code-block:: jnc

	struct MyUnion {
		union {
			char m_c;
			short m_s;
			int m_i;
		};
	};

	struct MyStruct: MyUnion {
		long m_l;
	}

Another distinction is needed to prevent unions from being used (intentionally or accidentally) from damaging Jancy meta-data such as virtual function tables or safe pointer validators.

.. note::

	Unions can only containt POD-types.

Let me remind you that POD-types in Jancy are :ref:`primitive types <primitive-types>` and all their aggregations via arrays, structs or unions.

This rule means, that the following code will **not compile**:

.. code-block:: jnc

	class MyClass {
		// ...
	}

	union MyUnion {
		MyClass m_c;     // <-- error: non-POD
		char const* m_p; // <-- error: non-POD
		long m_a[2];
	}
