Full Property Declaration
=========================

A full property declaration looks a lot like a declaration for a class. It implicitly opens a namespace and allows for overloaded setters, member fields, helper methods, constructors/destructors etc.

.. code-block:: jnc

	property g_prop {
		int m_x = 5; // member field with in-place initializer

		int get() {
			return m_x;
		}

		set(int x) {
			m_x = x;
			update();
		}

		set(double x); // overloaded setter
		update(); // helper method
	}

A body of a method can be placed right away (Java-style *inline* body definition) or outside -- maybe even in another file (C++-style *out-of-line* body definition).
