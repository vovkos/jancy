Class Pointers
==============

Pointer arithmetic is **not applicable** to **class pointers**, therefore, class pointer validity can be ensured by performing a **null-check**.

Jancy provides built-in support for a special kind of class pointers: **"weak"**. These pointers **don't affect the lifetime** of an object. Obviously, weak class pointers cannot be used to access an object they point to and can only be **cast to strong** pointers. If this cast operation returns non-null value, the result can be used to access the object normally; otherwise, the object has already been destroyed.

.. code-block:: jnc

	class C1 {
		//...
	}

	void foo() {
		C1* c = new C1;
		C1 weak* w = c;

		// if we lose a strong pointer before GC run, the object will be collected

		std.collectGarbage();

		c = w; // try to restore strong pointer

		if (c) {
			// the object is still alive
		}
	}
