Jancy Language Manual
=====================

Jancy is a **scripting programming language** with **LLVM** back-end. Jancy offers a lot of convenient features for low-level IO (input-output) and UI (user-interface) programming which are not found in mainstream languages (and sometimes, nowhere else). This includes safe pointer arithmetics, high level of source-level and ABI compatibility with C, reactive programming, built-in generator of incremental lexers/scanners and a lot more.
