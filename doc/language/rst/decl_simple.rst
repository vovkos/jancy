Simple Declarations
===================

Syntax of declarations in Jancy is common for all the C-family languages and can be expressed with the following formula: **specifier(s)-declarator(s)**.

.. code-block:: jnc

	int a;

In example above ``int`` is a type specifier and ``a`` is a declarator. This declaration creates a new integer variable (or field) named ``a`` -- just like you would expect in C-world. Unlike C/C++ language though, any uninitialized variable in Jancy is **zero-initialized**, so ``a`` will be holding **zero**.

Declaring **functions** in Jancy is also similar to any C-family language:

.. code-block:: jnc

	void foo(
		int a,
		double b
	) {
		// ...
	}

This defines a function which return no value and takes two arguments of types ``int`` and ``double`` -- again, nothing unexpected here.

It's important to say a couple of words on **arrays**, however. In Java, C\#, D and other modern languages arrays are **dynamically-sized**; in C/C++ compiler-generated arrays are **fixed-sized** while dynamically-sized arrays are implemented as classes. Since being able to copy-paste C/C++ declarations of network protocol headers was crucial, Jancy adopts C/C++ model:

.. code-block:: jnc

	int a[10][20];

This declares a two-dimensional array of integers (10 rows and 20 columns) named ``a``. Now let's proceed to something more complex.
