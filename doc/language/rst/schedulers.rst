Schedulers
==========

Jancy implements the concept of function pointer scheduling. When passing a function pointers as a callback of some sort (completion routine, event handler etc) you are free to assign it a user-defined “scheduler”. The purpose of this scheduler is to ensure the execution of your callback in the correct environment (i.e. a specific worker thread, from within a Windows Message handler, under lock/mutex, and so on).

The scheduler is a built-in interface of the Jancy compiler:

.. code-block:: jnc

	namespace jnc {

	class Scheduler {
		abstract schedule(function* f ());
	}

	} // namespace jnc {

Note that even the ``schedule`` method accepts a pointer to a function with no arguments, and you can schedule functions with arbitrary argument list, as arguments will be captured in the closure object.

To assign a scheduler you use @ operator (at):

.. code-block:: jnc

	class WorkerThread: jnc.Scheduler {
		override schedule(function* f()) {
			// enqueue f and signal worker thread event
		}

		void workerThread() {
			for (;;) {
				// wait for worker thread event

				function* f() = getNextRequest ();
				f();
			}
		}
	}

	void foo(int x);

	void bar() {
		WorkerThread workerThread;

		function* f(int) = foo @ workerThread; // create a scheduled pointer

		(foo @ workerThread)(100); // or schedule now

		// ...

		f(200); // call through a scheduled pointer
	}

Below is a real-life example (from our IO Ninja software) of assigning a socket event handler (which gets fired from within the socket IO thread) and scheduling it to be called from the main UI thread:

.. code-block:: jnc

	TcpListenerSession.construct(doc.PluginHost* pluginHost) {
		// ...

		m_listenerSocket = new io.Socket();
		m_listenerSocket.m_onSocketEvent +=
			onListenerSocketEvent @ pluginHost.m_mainThreadScheduler;

		// ...
	}
