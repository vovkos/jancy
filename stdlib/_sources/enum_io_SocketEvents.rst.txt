bitflag enum io.SocketEvents
============================

Overview
~~~~~~~~

This enumeration contains codes of all possible events that might
happen on `io.Socket` object. The set of *active* events is accessible
via `io.Socket.m_activeEvents`. :ref:`More...<details-typeio_socketevents>`

Enum Values
-----------

.. index:: pair: enumvalue; IncomingConnection
.. _doxid-enum_memberio_socketevents_incomingconnection:

.. ref-code-block:: jancy
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	IncomingConnection

New incoming client connection is pending on the listening server
socket. The new client can be accepted using the ``accept`` method
(to reject the connection you still have to accept it first, and then
close it)

.. index:: pair: enumvalue; TcpConnected
.. _doxid-enum_memberio_socketevents_tcpconnected:

.. ref-code-block:: jancy
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	TcpConnected

TCP connection established.

.. index:: pair: enumvalue; TcpDisconnected
.. _doxid-enum_memberio_socketevents_tcpdisconnected:

.. ref-code-block:: jancy
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	TcpDisconnected

TCP connection has been terminated by the remote node. If the remote node
used ``TCP`` reset, then `io.SocketEvents.TcpReset` will be set at the same
time. Note that if connection was terminated by the local node (using
``close``), the ``TcpDisconnected`` event is **not fired**.

.. index:: pair: enumvalue; TcpReset
.. _doxid-enum_memberio_socketevents_tcpreset:

.. ref-code-block:: jancy
	:class: doxyrest-title-code-block

	TcpReset

Connection has been abruptly reset by the remote node. Whenever this
event is set, `io.SocketEvents.TcpDisconnected` is also set. Note that if
connection was terminated by the local node(using `io.Socket.close`),
``Disconnect`` event is **not** fired.
