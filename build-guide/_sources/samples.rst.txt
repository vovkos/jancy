Samples
=======

After Jancy is successfully built and tested, you should probably check out the ``./samples`` folder.

* ``jnc``

	This sub-folder contains multiple Jancy source files demonstrating most prominent **language features**.

* ``jnc_sample_01_embed_c``

	This sample demonstrates how to embed Jancy as a **scripting engine** into a pure C program. The sample also shows how to implement **Jancy classes in C** and how to export them into the namespace of the script, thus providing two-way interaction between the script and the host application.

	Run it as::

		jnc_sample_01_embed_c <path-to-script>

	Sample script could be found at: ``./samples/jnc_sample_01_embed_c/script.jnc``

* ``jnc_sample_02_embed_cpp``

	This sample is a C++ counterpart of the previous sample. It demonstrates how to embed Jancy as a **scripting engine** into C++ program and how to implement **Jancy classes in C++**.

	Run it as::

		jnc_sample_02_embed_cpp <path-to-script>

	Sample script could be found at: ``./samples/jnc_sample_02_embed_cpp/script.jnc``

* ``jnc_sample_03_dialog``

	This sample demonstrates how to create a Jancy **binding to QT** widget classes and how to apply Jancy **reactive programming** concepts to UI programming.

	Obviously, this sample requires QT to be built and run.

	Run it as::

		jnc_sample_03_dialog <path-to-script>

	Sample script could be found at: ``./samples/jnc_sample_03_dialog/script.jnc``

You can also check out ``./test/test_qt`` -- a Jancy editor capable of compiling and running user code.

This QT application is constantly used by us for troubleshooting and bug-fixing of Jancy compiler, Jancy runtime, and Jancy standard library. What makes this application really convenient for the said purpose is the blend of *editor*, *compiler* and *runtime* -- all in confines of the single process, which makes everything as *debugger-friendly* as possible.
