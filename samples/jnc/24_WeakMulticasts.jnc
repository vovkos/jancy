// Perhaps the most well known scenario in which weak pointers are necessary is
// the event-subscriber pattern: usually the developer does not want a pointer
// held by an event to prevent the subscriber from being collected. This leads
// to subtle and hard to track leaks/bugs.

// Jancy's solution to this problem is the out-of-the-box support for weak
// multicasts.
